# Things that would be nice to have

So, first, welcome to the project! I tried my best to structure and prepare the project for the inevitable new developers, so I hope you find it helpful.

I have included all the notes I've taken at our meetings; not sure how helpful they can be, since they were mostly written in shorthand, but it's there nonetheless.

Anyways here's a list of features that would be nice to implement. Feel free to edit anything here.

## Features to come
- Submission diffing
    - Currently the program uses the FIRST submission as the submitted date for the assignment, even if they edit it afterwards. It would be nice to evaluate any further updates to the submission as either significant or minor. This way you can't cheat the system.
- Type checking system
    - Currently, to supply to correct values for the review, the client will have to know the value either through copy/paste or some external source, like the data files. It would be nice to have some sort of type checking of the inputed review parameters or even show the client the available choices to pick from.
- Config maker
    - Currently, the necessary options will be resolved dynamically on the fly if no configs could be found. It would be nice if these options were also given the option to be saved to file.
